📂 CDC – Coding & DSA Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems that I’m solving consistently. Each solution follows a clean structure with:

✅ Approach / Logic Explanation
✅ Time & Space Complexity
✅ Clean & Optimized Code
✅ Problem-wise File Structure

🚀 Repository Goals

This repo is created to:

Track my DSA progress

Maintain well-documented code

Improve problem-solving consistency

Build a strong GitHub portfolio

📘 Languages Used

All solutions are implemented in:

C++ (Primary)

Future additions may include:

Python

Java

📁 Folder Structure (Optional Layout)
cdc/
├── Arrays/
├── Strings/
├── TwoPointers/
├── Sorting/
├── Recursion/
├── Hashing/
└── README.md


(Currently, all solutions are being added directly — structure will evolve as more problems are added.)

✅ Format Followed in Each File

Every solution includes:

✅ Problem Approach

✅ Time Complexity

✅ Space Complexity

✅ Clean code comments (when needed)

Example:

/*
Approach:
Time Complexity:
Space Complexity:
*/

🔄 How to Use

You can clone the repository using:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cdc.git


Navigate and compile any file as needed.

📌 Future Plans

Categorize problems into folders

Add brute force vs optimized approaches

Add problem links (LeetCode/GFG/CodeStudio)
