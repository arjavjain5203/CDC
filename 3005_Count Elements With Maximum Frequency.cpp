/*
ðŸ”¹ Approach:
1. We maintain a frequency array `count` of size 101 to store the occurrences of numbers 
   (based on the assumption that values in nums are in the range 0â€“100).
2. In the first loop, we count the frequency of each element and track the maximum frequency.
3. In the second loop, we count how many elements occur with this maximum frequency.
4. Finally, we compute the total elements that have the maximum frequency as: maxfreq * count

âœ… Example:
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4]
Frequencies â†’ {1:2, 2:2, 3:1, 4:1}
Maximum frequency = 2
Elements with this frequency: 1 and 2 â†’ 2 numbers
Answer = 2 * 2 = 4

ðŸ”¹ Time Complexity:
O(n + k)  
- O(n) for iterating over nums  
- O(k) for scanning the frequency array (here k = 101)

ðŸ”¹ Space Complexity:
O(1)  
Size of frequency array is constant (101)
